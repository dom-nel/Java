/*
   Yes, you are on the right track. In the code you provided, you are correctly calculating the sum of the first n natural 
   numbers using the formula (n * (n + 1)) / 2, where n is the length of the array. This step is essential to solving the 
   "Missing Number" problem, as it gives you the expected sum of all the numbers in the range from 1 to n.

   The next steps involve calculating the sum of the elements in the array and then finding the missing number by subtracting
    the array sum from the expected sum. You can proceed with these steps to complete the solution for the problem.
